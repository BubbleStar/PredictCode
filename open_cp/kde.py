    estimators.

    The predictor itself is simple.  We select an interval time (or all time)
    and use just the data from that time range.  The distance in time from each
    event to the end time is calculated, and optionally a "time kernel" is
    calculated: typically this kernel falls off in time, so that events in the
    past are waited less.
    
    The space locations are events are then passed to a kernel density
    estimator.  Finally (in a slightly non-standard way) the space kernel is
    weighted by the time kernel to produce a "risk surface".
